# Guessing-the-States-of-America
This project is a fun and interactive Python-based game where users guess the names of the 50 U.S. states. Built using the turtle graphics library and pandas, it displays a blank map of the United States and prompts users to input state names. When a correct guess is entered, the state name is displayed at the appropriate location on the map.
