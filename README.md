# Guessing-the-States-of-America
This project is a fun and interactive Python-based game where users guess the names of the 50 U.S. states. Built using the turtle graphics library and pandas, it displays a blank map of the United States and prompts users to input state names. When a correct guess is entered, the state name is displayed at the appropriate location on the map.
Features

Interactive GUI using the Turtle library.
Real-time feedback for each correct guess.
Stores unguessed states in a CSV file (missing states.csv) when the user exits the game.
Helps improve U.S. geography knowledge in a game-like format.
